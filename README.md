# BMI Tracker

This project was the first project I completed for my Advanced Web Development class. This project makes use of ASP.NET Core as well as the MVC architecture. This project was created in Visual Studio with version 1.1.* of ASP.NET Core.

This project is meant to help a personal trainer keep track of all their clients. It tracks their info and calculates their BMI. It allows for basic CRUD operations on the clients. The project also allows you to view reports for 3 different weight classes. To view theses reports, navigate to /profiles/reports.
